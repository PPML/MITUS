# MITUS
Modeling Interventions of Tuberculosis in the United States 

### Project Goals
The goal of the MITUS package is to provide a deterministic model to investigate the impacts of various TB control strategies in the United States. The model has been calibrated to national and state level data for a select number of states. Built-in control strategies are in three broad categories: 
- pre-defined scenarios
- programmatic changes to the LTBI and active TB diagnosis and care cascades
- targeted testing and treatment of customizable risk groups
