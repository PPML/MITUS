Calibration Functions for use with the tb_model.cpp model for state level
This script creates several individual log likelihood functions
for the calibration of the State Level TB model in tb_model.cpp
These llikelihood functions are called in IMIS_functions.R
takes in the outputs and calibration data and creates likelihood functions
Motivation: Normal, mean centered with CI = +/- 5% of the mean
